## Instructions
Compile the file, and then execute the output with the file path to the file that you would like to analyze.
You may continue analyzing files as long as you want, at which point you can exit.

## Output
This program will output the following once per session:
- Student Data
  - Name
  - ID
  - Email

The program will output the following once per file analyzed:
- General Stats
  - Sum
  - Mean
  - Variance
  - Standard deviation
- The probability of each individual nucleotide being selected (1.0 = 100%):
  - A, T, C, G
- The probability of each nucleotide bigram being selected (1.0 = 100%):
  - AA, AT, AG, AC, TA, etc.
- A thousand new DNA sequences based on the given input

## Bugs
When you run the program on strings generated by the program, the means, standard deviations, and variances are slightly different. I believe that this is from a rounding error caused by the strings all being output with even lengths, which was done to ensure that the program can analyze its output as another input (since the bigram analysis requires that we have strings of an even length).
